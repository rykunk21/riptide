	•	🧰 Bundling tools: Manage CLI-based ML tools in one place
	•	🛠️ Workflow control: Execute, monitor, and debug ML stages interactively
	•	🌊 TUI interface: Visualize your models, datasets, logs, and pipeline stages from the terminal
	•	⚙️ Modular design: Add your own custom toolchains and workflows
