# Riptide Requirements

## 1. Overview  
Riptide is a nautical-themed CLI + TUI toolkit for managing end-to-end MLOps workflows from the terminal. It integrates multiple modular sub-tools into a cohesive interface for orchestration, monitoring, and visualization of ML pipelines.

---

## 2. Core Functional Requirements  

### 2.1 CLI Launcher  
- **FR-CLI-01**: User can install Riptide via `cargo install riptide`.  
- **FR-CLI-02**: Running `riptide launch` opens the TUI dashboard.  
- **FR-CLI-03**: CLI supports commands for:
  - Listing available submodules
  - Installing submodules
  - Running submodules directly without TUI
  - Viewing logs in plain CLI mode  

### 2.2 TUI Interface  
- **FR-TUI-01**: Must provide navigable sections for:
  - Tool registry
  - Workflow visualizer
  - Logs and metrics viewer
- **FR-TUI-02**: Navigation should use keyboard shortcuts (configurable).  
- **FR-TUI-03**: Must display live updates from running pipelines.  
- **FR-TUI-04**: Must support vertical/horizontal split panes for different views.  

### 2.3 Tool Orchestration  
- **FR-ORCH-01**: User can define workflows linking CLI tools and submodules in sequence.  
- **FR-ORCH-02**: Must support conditional execution (e.g., run stage only if previous succeeded).  
- **FR-ORCH-03**: Must allow both interactive execution (step-by-step) and batch execution.  
- **FR-ORCH-04**: Hooks system for adding shell scripts or binaries at specific pipeline stages.  

### 2.4 Live Monitoring  
- **FR-MON-01**: Display logs from any stage in real time.  
- **FR-MON-02**: Display structured metrics (loss, accuracy, etc.) in tables or charts.  
- **FR-MON-03**: Allow filtering logs by stage or keyword.  

### 2.5 Extensibility  
- **FR-EXT-01**: Users can register their own CLI tools as Riptide submodules.  
- **FR-EXT-02**: Registered tools must appear in the Tool Registry with metadata (name, description, version).  
- **FR-EXT-03**: Support a plugin system for distributing community-made submodules (future).

## 3. Submodule Requirements  

### 3.1 DOCK (Data Organization and Cleaning Kit)  
- **FR-DOCK-01**: List datasets in a local or configured data directory.  
- **FR-DOCK-02**: Provide cleaning operations (e.g., drop nulls, normalize, encode categories).  
- **FR-DOCK-03**: Track dataset versions.  
- **FR-DOCK-04**: Export cleaned data to standard formats (CSV, Parquet).  

### 3.2 SAIL (Stats, Automation, and Inferencing Library)  
- **FR-SAIL-01**: Train models on specified datasets.  
- **FR-SAIL-02**: Run inference on trained models.  
- **FR-SAIL-03**: Automate hyperparameter sweeps.  
- **FR-SAIL-04**: Output performance metrics in a standard JSON format.  

### 3.3 SURF (Simulated UI Rating Framework)  
- **FR-SURF-01**: Run evaluation pipelines simulating user interaction.  
- **FR-SURF-02**: Capture and log simulated user ratings.  
- **FR-SURF-03**: Output comparative performance reports across models.  

### 3.4 BUOY (Behavioral Uptime and Observability Yield)  
- **FR-BUOY-01**: Monitor deployed models or services for uptime and latency.  
- **FR-BUOY-02**: Log anomalies and downtime events.  
- **FR-BUOY-03**: Export monitoring results to JSON/CSV.  

---

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements  

### 4.1 Performance  
- **NFR-01**: TUI must handle pipelines with at least 20 stages without lag.  
- **NFR-02**: CLI startup should be under 1s on modern hardware.  

### 4.2 Compatibility  
- **NFR-03**: Must work on Linux, macOS, and Windows.  
- **NFR-04**: Terminal must support Unicode and ANSI colors.  

### 4.3 Usability  
- **NFR-05**: Provide context-sensitive help in both CLI and TUI.  
- **NFR-06**: Default keyboard shortcuts should be discoverable via a help panel.  

### 4.4 Extensibility  
- **NFR-07**: Adding a new submodule should require no modification to the Riptide core.

## 5. Future Requirements (Roadmap)  
- **FUT-01**: YAML-based pipeline definitions.  
- **FUT-02**: Remote deployment integration.  
- **FUT-03**: Native Hugging Face datasets + models support.  
- **FUT-04**: Community plugin registry.
